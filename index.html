    <!--Here is my answer to question 3-->

    <p> One planet that exists in the solar system is Jupiter. Jupiter is the <strong>largest planet</strong> that is in the solar system. Jupiter is also the <i>fifth planet</i> from the sun. Jupiter is known for it's large red spot which is actually a massive storm that is occuring on the planet. The storm has been going on for <u>over 150 years</u>! Jupiter also has a total of 95 moons that orbit around it. </p>

        <p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 24; font-style: #000854; text-align: right; "> Newton's thought experiment for getting into orbit works by imagining having a cannon on a very high mountin on the Earth. When fired the cannon ball will follow its ballistic arc and return back to Earth as a result of gravity. As you pack more and more gunpowder into the cannon it will go farther and faster all while falling back to earth at the same speed. When it reaches a point where in never touches back down and falls completely around the Earth it has entered orbit. The periapsis of a spacecraft is when it is the closest it will get to Earth in it's orbit. The apoapsis is when it is the farthest from Earth it will get in it's orbit.  </p>
